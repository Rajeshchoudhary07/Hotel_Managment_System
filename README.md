## CONCLUSION

•	While developing this project we have learnt a lot about hotel management.

•	The online hotel reservation system was developed to replace the manual process of booking for a hotel room or any other facility of the hotel.

•	The old system does not serve the customer in a better way; rather it makes customer data vulnerable.

•	The new system keeps proper record of customer for emergency and security purposes.

•	We have learnt how to make a system user friendly.

•	We also realized the importance of maintaining a minimal margin for error.

•	During the development process we studied carefully and understood the criteria of implementation process.
