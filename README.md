# Hotel_Managment_System_With_MySQL
## INTRODUCTION OF  HOTEL  MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Hotel Management System is a software application developed to automate and streamline hotel operations, focusing on the efficient management of rooms, customers, and bookings. The system enables hotel staff to perform essential tasks such as adding new rooms, managing customer information, and handling room bookings. This system is designed for small to medium-sized hotels that require a simple, intuitive interface to manage daily operations without the need for extensive manual effort.

Built using Python and MySQL, the system utilizes a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with users and a MySQL database to store and manage hotel data. Key functionalities include room management (adding, modifying, and searching for room details), customer management (adding and updating customer information), and booking management (booking rooms and tracking occupancy).

By automating these processes, the Hotel Management System reduces the likelihood of errors, improves data accuracy, and enhances the overall operational efficiency of the hotel. The system's search capabilities allow quick access to room status, customer information, and booking history, ensuring smooth operation and improved customer service. This proposed system will be interactive ,faster and user –friendly for the end users . using the hotel management system , the following activities can be performed.

1.Add New Room

2.Add Customer

3.Modify Room Information

4.Modify Customer Information

5.Room Booking

6.Search Database

7.Close application

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to develop a Hotel Management System that streamlines the management of hotel room reservations, customer details, and booking status. The system will allow hotel staff to easily add, update, and search for room and customer information, as well as manage room bookings. The system should provide an intuitive interface, automate key processes, and ensure accurate tracking of data for efficient hotel operations.

## CONCLUSION

•	While developing this project we have learnt a lot about hotel management.

•	The online hotel reservation system was developed to replace the manual process of booking for a hotel room or any other facility of the hotel.

•	The old system does not serve the customer in a better way; rather it makes customer data vulnerable.

•	The new system keeps proper record of customer for emergency and security purposes.

•	We have learnt how to make a system user friendly.

•	We also realized the importance of maintaining a minimal margin for error.

•	During the development process we studied carefully and understood the criteria of implementation process.
